          <p class="portfolio-description">
            The goal was to create the possibility for uploading specifically formatted CSVs. 
            Together with a UX Designer, we created a User Journey based on user data we already aggregated. 
            In parallel we had to explore different solutions for uploading files into a specific part of the software. 
            Afterwards we decided to create a paper prototype from the results of the User Journey. 
            One of our co-workers, who worked in the same area as our target-group users tested the prototype and told his opinion about the User Flow. 
            Based on his opinions we started to mock-up several drag and drop uploaders.
            The main reasons to create a drag and drop uploader, were: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Simple to understand
              </li>
              <li>
                Accessible 
              </li>
              <li>
                Easy to use
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="portfolio-description">
            Afterwards we decided to interview some of our customers about the functionality and usability for the first iteration.
